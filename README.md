# SkimLit-NLP-Project
In this project, we are implementing a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model based on the 2017 paper PubMed 200k RCT, aiming to classify sentences within medical abstracts into specific roles (e.g., objective, methods, results). 
The ultimate goal is to facilitate efficient literature review for researchers by allowing them to skim through abstracts and delve deeper when necessary, addressing the challenge posed by the increasing number of Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) papers with unstructured abstracts. 
The project involves downloading the PubMed RCT200k dataset, preprocessing the data, conducting various modeling experiments, and building a multimodal model to replicate the architecture proposed in the referenced paper.
